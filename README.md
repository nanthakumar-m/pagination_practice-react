# 📄 Pagination Practice – React 

The Pagination Practice App is a React-based application designed to demonstrate how to display large sets of data in chunks. It shows a list of statements and provides buttons to navigate between pages, helping users easily browse limited items at a time.

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience in implementing pagination logic in React using **array slicing, state management, and event handling**. It helped improve UI clarity by organizing data into navigable pages instead of displaying all at once.
